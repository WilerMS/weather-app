## Context and Description
---
I decided to build this application to learn about React. In this app I practiced different kind of things, such as the state management, hooks and custom hooks implementation, context and integration with apis.

## User guide
---
You, like the user who is using this application, just have to writte the name of the country, town or region you want to know the current weather. After that, you will get:
- The current weather in that location
- The humidity
- The current temperature
- Min and max temperature.

- Execute the available scripts as you want.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
